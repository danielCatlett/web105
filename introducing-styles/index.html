    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    
    <h2>Me Personally</h2>
    
    <h3>Interesting things about myself</h3>
    <p>I don't personally think I'm all that interesting, but I can say that I play Super Smash Bros. competitively, so that's pretty cool. I also have seen almost every episode of Star Trek in existence, and plan on having seen them all by the time Discovery comes out.</p>
    
    <h3>A Picture of Me</h3>
    <p>Here is my current profile picture on Facebook. My caption is below.</p>
    <img src="profilePicture.jpg" alt="Face shot">
    <p>I decided I should probably change my profile picture. So, I thought to myself "self, what's the coolest possible profile picture I could take?" I decided on wearing sunglasses indoors while eating a lollipop.</p>
    
    <h2>My Programming Experience</h2>
    
    <h3>Why I Chose My Major</h3>
    <p>I am in the Mobile Development program, and will be getting my degree next spring. I chose it because I was encouraged by a friend to take AP Computer Science in High School, and I greatly enjoyed it. So I decided last semester to take Android Programming 1 for fun, and that is how I learned about the degree. I decided that I wanted to do it.</p>
    
    <h3>My Previous Programming Experience</h3>
    <p>I've already mentioned that I took APCS and Android 1. Both of those were Java classes, so I got a pretty good handle on the basics of the language at this point. I also have some experience with C++, and a pretty decent understanding of how Github works. This is my first experience with web development, however, so this is all new territory for me.</p>
    
    <h2>My Goals for This Course</h2>
    <p>I am hoping to gain a fundamental understanding of how the web works from this class, so that I will maybe be able to use it at some point, whether for a job, or personally.</p>
