       <h1>I don't get it. Ever used Ganondorf?</h1>
   </header>
    <div class="container" id="roboto">
        <h1>Category: Sans Serif<br>Font: Roboto</h1>
        <h1>I was just wondering why Ganondorf is in the very middle of the tiers.</h1>
        <h2>Before I get into what I mean, allow me to first put out there that I have been playing for years, and I have watched MANY videos of the tournament masters.</h2>
        <h3>My brother and I found out, through years of play, literally EVERY advanced technique in the game, except the wavedash, which we stumbled upon, but wrote off as simply hilarious.</h3>
        <h4>I was surprised to find that all the wacky observations we have encountered and adapted are actually defined in the glossary in the sticky topic above!</h4>
        <h5>Three of the particularly surprising terms that I could not believe had been widely known and utilized were the Phantom Hit (I just thought I had a glitchy game) and that effect where recovering at the right time from attacks that sent you flying results in an upward boost if you jump out/air dodge/whatever early enough (I cannot remember what it was called in the sticky), and the waveland.</h5>
        <h6>Now, I have been using Ganondorf against my brother lately, and he cannot seem to beat me.</h6>
        <p>We think we know why, and we think it puts Ganon at the top of the tiers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="lora">
        <h1>Category: Serif<br>Font: Lora</h1>
        <h1>I will be brief. Ganondorf has his air forward.</h1>
        <h2>We call it 'The Punch.'</h2>
        <h3>It has that special hitbox like a sword, hence it goes right through anything except an attack with that same type of hitbox.</h3>
        <h4> It does 17% max, is relatively fast executing, has basically instant recovery on a barrier cancel, and is quite massive, killing at rather low percentages.</h4>
        <h5>If he misses, he can just do his A punch if the opponent tries to retaliate, or shield/roll.</h5>
        <h6>I am telling you, Ganondorf is a crazy meat mountain who crushes bones with many attacks doing 15+%, survives to insane damages thanks to his weight, and has ridiculous horizontal recovery (Double Jump, Ganondorf Kick Down B, ANOTHER Double Jump, ARE YOU SERIOUS, Up B).</h6>
        <p>Next, check his roll.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="diplomata">
        <h1>Category: Display<br>Font: Diplomata SC</h1>
        <h1>It goes like half screen.</h1>
        <h2>It makes him rather fast, nearly eliminating his speed problem on the ground, and a great character when it comes to the defensive game.</h2>
        <h3>It pretty much eliminates the need for his wavedash, which, with Ganondorf, who needs to do most of his attacking from hops, is pretty much useless already unless you are looking to smash attack.</h3>
        <h4>Wavesmashing, however, in my opinion, is also a bad idea, because, in the time and damage it takes you to actually land a smash, you could have just used The Punch and killed you opponent by then.</h4>
        <h5>Even though he has to fight mostly in the air, 3 of his 4 air attacks are pretty fast, and are quite massive.</h5>
        <h6>A major advantage he has is that nearly all his attacks move the opponent considerably, and can topple him from 0%, so his opponent gets little to no counterattack opportunity.</h6>
        <p>The only explanation I can find for why he is low on the tiers is that no one has used him seriously.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="architect">
        <h1>Category: Handwriting<br>Font: Architect's Daughter</h1>
        <h1>I think he really keeps up, if not tops, the top tier characters.</h1>
        <h2>I really do not like to simply shoot my mouth, and I am not one who thinks it right to shower a character in encomium, and never actually prove anything.</h2>
        <h3>Is there online for this somewhere, or is that simply wishful thinking?</h3>
        <h4>If not, please do not yell at me and stuff until you at least check out The Punch.</h4>
        <h5>Goes right through projectiles, goes right through attacks, goes right through faces.</h5>
        <h6>Please just give Ganondorf another shot and tell me what you thnk.</h6>
        <p>Final Comment: People have a tendency to think that posts from newcomers to a board but veterans of its respective game are saying they are better than everyone else, regardles of what the post actually says.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="nova">
        <h1>Category: Monospace<br>Font: Nova Mono</h1>
        <h1>Please note that I did not say 'I am better than you' or 'Ganon is better than Fox.'</h1>
        <h2>I said, essentially: 'Ganon seems to be great.</h2>
        <h3>These are his strengths.</h3>
        <h4>He may top Fox.</h4>
        <h5>Check him out and see if you agree.'</h5>
        <h6>I will say, however, that I am a full master of Ganondorf.</h6>
        <p>Please give Ganondorf a second look before responding so you know where I am coming from!</p>
