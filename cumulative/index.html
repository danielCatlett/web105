            <p id="top">If you are reading this right now, odds are you fall into one of two categories</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You are grading this assignment, or</li>
                <li>You are looking at my portfolio, and considering me for a job</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you fall into the first category, then HI MERI! PLEASE GIVE ME AN A! I REALLY WANT AN A IN THIS CLASS! THIS IS A TOTALLY AWESOME SITE THAT SHOULD TOTALLY GET AN A, SO THAT I CAN GET AN A IN THIS CLASS!</p>
            <p id="bottom">If you fall into the second category, then please forget what you just read, and read this instead. *ahem* Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening Mr/Ms/Mrs Interviewer Person. I would humbly ask that you consider hiring me for the position that I presumably applied for. I am a honored that you would consider me for a position in your fantastic company, and would ask that you take this website as evidence that I have mastered the basics of web design in the HTML/CSS framework. I would encourage you to tour this site to see all that it has to offer. Except for the page labelled Meri. That page is for her eyes only, and would ask that you do not visit there unless absolutely necessary.</p>
