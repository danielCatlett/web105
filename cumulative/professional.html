            <p id="top">Hello Mr/Ms/Mrs Professional Person! I am thrilled you are considering me for your fine company, and would be truly honored to be offerred a position there! Let me tell you about myself. I am hard working, dedicated, and my biggest weakness is definitely caring too much. I can picture myself at your company now. Here is a bit what it would look like.</p>

            <p>As you can see, if you hire me, I will make you lots of money, and your stocks will go way up.</p>
            <p>Still not convinced? Well, I whipped up a quick diagram of all the benefits of having me employed at your company.</p>

            <p id="bottom">If that isn't conclusive proof that I am what your company needs, than I don't know what is.</p>
