            <p>What type of movie is The Room? Primarily, it's a tragedy. It is a story that explores what happens when we are betrayed by those closest to us, and what happens when you only "look out for #1"</p>

                <aside>A breathtaking view of LA, and Football? Count me in!</aside>
            </div>
            <p>However, that's not all this movie is about. In much the way The Princess Bride has something for everyone, this movie has everything. Action, drama, sex, rage, violence, sports, friendship, loss, inspiring quotes, a fantastic score, sweeping vistas, it's got it all.</p>

                <img src="cast-photo.jpg" alt="Photo of Danielle, Wiseau, and Sistero">
                <aside>From left to right, Danielle, Wiseau, Sistero</aside>
            </div>
            <p>The movie is about the love triangle between Jonny (played by Tommy Wiseau), his fiance Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his best friend Mark (Greg Sestero).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container2">
            <div class="imagecaption">
                <img src="denny-rooftop.jpg" alt="Johnny and Denny on the rooftop" id="denny">
                <aside>Johnny comforting his surrogate son, Denny, in one of the most iconic scenes in the movie</aside>
            </div>
            <p>The film explores the weeks leading up to Johnny and Lisa's wedding, as she falls out of love with him, and begins an affair with Mark. The talented Wiseau brings Johnny to life before our eyes, playing a character that goes from having it all, to a shell of a man who has nothing. We see fantastic performances from Sestero and Danielle, who really do make me believe in the manipulative Lisa and tortured Mark, and I feel for those two almost as much as I do for Johnny at the end.</p>
            <p>Of course, the movie isn't just these three. There is a fantastic revolving door supporting cast, who are always there to do everything from explicitly tell me how each of the main characters are feeling at any given time, to harassing the main characters into dropping everything they are doing to play football, to being the target of an inspirational speech. </p>

            <p>Basically what I am saying is that you are screwing up if you haven't already seen this movie. You should fix that as soon as possible. I recommend checking it out with some friends, so as to share the love with as many people as possible.</p>
