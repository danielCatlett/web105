    <h1>Super Smash Bros. Melee Review</h1>
    <h2>Is it the perfect game? <mark>Maybe</mark></h2>
    <p><em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, released for the Nintendo Gamecube in 2001, is the sequel to the platform fighter <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> for the N64 (aka Smash 64). It features Nintendo characters from various franchises duking it out across iconic locations such as the Mushroom Kingdom, Hyrule Castle, Dreamland, Pokemon Stadium, and many more. With all the fan service packed into the games very concept, it's almost guaranteed that the game will sell well. But Melee is so much more than pitting Samus against Fox McCloud and seeing who would win. Melee was the best selling game on the Gamecube, and still has a quite lively community to this day, so there is clearly something more going on with this game.</p>
    <p>On a surface level, Melee packs quite a bit of content and polish than its predecessor. Smash 64 was a fun game about pitting Nintendo characters against each other and fighting it out, but it was far from a perfect game. The graphics were shoddy, even for a N64 game. There were only 12 characters and 9 stages, and very little in the way of single player content. However, it was the actual <strong>fighting</strong> system itself that most needed an update.</p>
    <p>In order for fighting games to be fun for both the player on the offense and defense, its attacking and defending mechanics must both be useful. However, Smash 64 is famous for its "touch of death" combo system. Smash 64 has very few options to protect yourself from getting hit. It also has very few options to get yourself out of trouble once you do get hit. This means that in order to do well in this game, you have to play extremely carefully to avoid getting hit. And if you do end up getting hit, a good player will usually be able to link it into massive damage, or maybe even a kill. Although this game has grown on people over the years, <del>very few people play the game a lot, since the game must be played so carefully.</del><small>There are probably people who won't like this statement so much</small></p>
    <p>However, when Melee came out, it fixed all of these problems, and then some.</p>
    <p>For starters, the game looks <ins>light years</ins> better. Although there was only about two years and one console generation difference between the two games, the visual difference is massive. Smash 64 looks dated today, but Melee's visual style still stands up to this day, and is clearly one of the best looking games on the Gamecube.</p>
    <p>But the improvements go far deeper than a new coat of paint. The entire gameplay experience was upgraded. The single player experience recieved a lot more content, the number of characters went from 12 to 26, and the stagelist grew from 9 to 29. But the real improvements came in the fighting system. Each character got a new move, new defensive options, and just moved crisper. The options allowed for fast, crisp play, that didn't lead the game being too defensive. Many hail this game as the best in the series, just for the gameplay alone. If anything, Melee is Smash 64<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>My favorite character in the game. His trophy description does an adequent job of explaining how he works</p>
    <blockquote>The tip of Marth's blade causes the most damage, so you should try to create adequate distance between you and your enemy to gracefully strike with that point. Marth's dolphin Slash is fast and powerful, but it leaves him vulnerable upon landing. Marth uses Counter to block a foe's attack and deal a return strike. If you're fighting a Counter-happy Marth, grab him.</blockquote>
    <p>And here is a link to one of the most famous moments in Smash history. Not because of the gameplay, but because of the iconic commentary by the legendary Peoples Champ, Bobby <q>Yo, did he just walk up,  slowly, and downsmash?</q> Scar. </p>
