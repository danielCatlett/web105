            <p>In order to get a picture for this page, I decided to search lazy music on Pixabay, and use the first thing that comes up, no matter what. This picture was the only thing that came up, so I used it.</p>
            <p>I couldn't think of a way to to fit music naturally into this site, or what music would make the most sense here. But then I realized that the assignment is to make sure that everything fits with a central theme. And since my central theme is being lazy, I would not be following my theme (and would thus deserve to be marked down) if I spent a lot of effort with making the songs fit naturally. So logically, I have no choice but to pick three random songs, and just sort of throw them in here on this page. If I didn't, I wouldn't be following the assignment!</p>

            <p>Anyways, here are three songs that I used in an entirely different project revolving around using songs. Hope you enjoy!</p>
