        <h1>Daniel's Favorite Smash Sets</h1>
        <p>I've seen a few Smash sets over the years, and most are fun to watch, but few stick with me. However, some matches are exciting enough that I remember them to this day. Here are my top six favorite matches.</p>

            <h2>6. The Big House 6 - Melee Winners Semis - Mang0 vs Armada</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7JQdxPmzQcY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>This was a set I actually was lucky enough to get to see live. Armada was the favorite to win, but Mang0 was still a real threat. However, it looked like it was over when Armada made short work of Mang0 at the start, and quickly went up 2-0 in a best of 5 set. However, Mang0 then proceeded to find it in himself to come back and win the set 3-2, making this the hypest reverse 3-0 I've ever seen. It also didn't hurt that since I was there live, I got to experience the energy in an incredibly real way. And if you look hard enough in the crowd, you might even see me!</p>

            <h2>5. EVO 2015 - Melee Top 32 - Chudat vs Hugs</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1psg7Msj9rI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>This set was sick for a number of reasons. First of all, I'm a big Chudat fan and a big Hugs hater, so it was a satisfying result. Second of all, Chu wasn't going to be able to go to EVO that year at all, since he had just lost his sponsor. But then a Facebook group that I am a part of stepped up and got him the funds to make it there. Third of all, winner of this set made top 8, which is something that nobody thought Chu was able to do anymore. But most importantly, Chu's sopo comeback in the last game was incredible, and his popoff after he won was even better.</p>

            <h2>4. EVO 2015 - Melee Losers Quarters - Leffen vs Plup</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVDT5UCwkNs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Another set from EVO 2015, but this one was probably the upset of the year in 2015, so it has to go on this list. Leffen was definitely top 2 in the world at the time, and Plup wasn't supposed to be able to come close to him in skill. Not only that, but him pulling out the Samus after making the full time switch to Shiek was one of the most unexpected yet genius moments I've ever seen.</p>

            <h2>3. EVO 2016 - Melee Grand Finals - Armada vs Hungrybox</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCJUdLd8Adc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>If there were a set that epitmoizes why Hbox is called Clutchbox, this would be it. There were so many moments that I was convinced Armada was going to win, but was proven wrong when Hungrybox pulled out an incredible last stock combo, or found a game winning rest out of nowhere. This is a long one (since it is actually two sets), but I was constantly on the edge of my seat when I was watching. Also, lets not forget Hbox's popoff after winning (if popoff is even the right word for what takes place).</p>

            <h2>2. Kings of Cali 4 - Winners Quarters - Mew2King vs aMSa</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDnKE5J7ki8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>This set is one of the most iconic (if not the most) upsets in Melee history. It's also probably the best example of commentator's curse in Melee history.</p>
            <blockquote>
                Lovage - Man, I love aMSa, but can you see him taking a match? <br>
                Scar - Ehh <br>
                Lovage - Ehhhh <br>
                Scar - Ehh
            </blockquote>
            <p>If only they knew...</p>

            <h2>1. APEX 2013 - Brawl Grand Finals - Mew2King vs Salem</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EBGffJfBkd0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>If you have been paying attention, you may have noticed a trend. All of the previous videos have been of Melee sets. That's because, as a whole, Melee is my favorite Smash game to watch. I think it is generally the most exciting, and has the most interesting storylines behind it. However, there is one set that will probably always be my favorite of all time, and it isn't a Melee set. It's the APEX 2013 Brawl Grand Finals. I first watched it not long after getting into competitive Smash, and I don't think I have ever seen a set that is longer, more back and forth, or more exciting since. Countless times I thought one of the players had it wrapped up, but then the other guy brought it back. The last stock of the last game alone was insane, and makes for better drama then pretty much anything I have ever seen on TV.</p>
